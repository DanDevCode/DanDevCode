# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DanDevCode. 
I'm a developer, I can't say that I'm advanced hehe I'm barely middle class
and every day I learn more than the day before you'll see that I've developed an extension and a 
website and seriously it's hard if you're just learning. For me it was difficult, but later it became 
easier for me to program, I am experimenting with Typescript (TS), C Sharp (C#), 
with API and with Artificial Intelligence (AI) I hope to become a great developer. ðŸ˜€
